## Solution

Solved with Rust 1.27.0 nightly-2018-04-07. https://rustup.rs/

### Usage

`cargo run (args)` and provide the list of numbers on stdin separated by whitespace.

Example:

```
(input)
```

Output:

```
(output)
```

Exits with non-zero if any errors occur.

Exits with zero if (condition). Exits with one if not.
